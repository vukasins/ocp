U vreme, kada je grupa sa vi&scaron;e vozila napustila naftno polje u pravcu severa, pripadnici ove grupe su bili nepovređeni - navodi Ministarstvo, dodajući da trenutno nema informacija o mestu boravka otetih.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U napadu Islamske države na naftno polje ubijeno je 11 pripadnika obezbeđenja, a Savičić i drugi stranci su oteti.

Therefore the development of two pilot management plans for NATURA 2000 areas will show how conservation objectives can be developed and how people who are living and working in these areas can participate on the management process. \nIn order to achieve these objectives a whole series of activities is planned including the analysis and assessment of the status quo, as well as workshops, seminars and trainings.
